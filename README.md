### Hi 😁
## I'm a Frontend Developer with 3 years (2022) of experience working with Angular ❤️‍🔥

- 🔧 I’ve spent the last few years building a complex data management web app using Angular and TypeScript – handling tons of dynamic data, filters, tables, and more. Not just UI polish – deep data workflows too and I still love it!
- 🧠 Currently, I’m diving into the world of .NET and backend development – fullstack is the next stop on my dev journey!
- ✨ I believe in learning by doing (and breaking things occasionally... on dev envs only 😅)

💼 My goal now? Becoming a fullstack developer who can build from database to frontend polish.
